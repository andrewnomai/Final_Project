# Final_Project

## Project Overview

We are looking at a dataset from Kaggle based upon the Netflix movie recommender system. This data is on all the movies that are available on the Netflix webiste, the duration of the movies, ratings from the IMDB website, votes by people, the year run-time, genre, and certificate. The goal is to analyze trends in which Netflix users create based upon the selection of movies. We picked this topic because we hope to predict which movies/shows would be successful in the future and in turn, provide what a base formula for what could be considered a successful movie in the future. 

### Purpose
We will clean and modify the Netflix movies data obtained from kaggle  in order to create a movie reccommendation system using machine learning. 

##### Questions to be answered
1. What genre has best votes/ratings by year?
2. What is, if any, the correlation between duration of movie and rating?
3. What is, if any, the correlation between age-rating of show/movie and the year it was released?
  In additon, what is there any correlation between more mature ratings and the popularity of a movie/show?
