# Final_Project

## Project Overview

We are looking at a dataset from Kaggle based upon the Netflix movie recommender system. This data is on all the movies that are available on the Netflix webiste, the duration of the movies, ratings from the IMDB website, votes by people, the year run-time, genre, and certificate. The goal is to analyze trends in which Netflix users create based upon the selection of movies. 

##### Questions to be answered
1. What genre has best votes/ratings by year?
2. What is, if any, the correlation between duration of movie and rating?
3. What is, if any, the correlation between age-rating of show/movie and the year it was released?
  In additon, what is there any correlation between more mature ratings and the popularity of a movie/show?
