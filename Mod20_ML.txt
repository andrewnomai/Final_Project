# Description
## We are analyzing certain columns from our movie data. Two of the columns we are focusing on are the film duration and the rating of the film out of 10.
## The data is visually represented by different versions of scatter plots along with tables displaying a prediction column as well as an actual column. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, our random_state was equal to 1 and our table for our prediction and actual columns contained zeros and 1 for each row.
## Our group felt that analyzing movie data was the best option because Netflix is a popular app that many individuals use and it is a major source of entertainment. The original data met the specified requirements for our project and I felt the columns displayed on the csv table were meaningful since these columns of data are used when watching something on Netflix. One advantage was that the csv table was able to be represented in a visual manner. However, a disadvantage was that some of the columns on the table that I thought would have been necessary to display in a scatter plot gave me an error. I was not able to have data represented for movie titles or the year the film was released since those values gave me an error. I felt that was disappointing because the movie title is the most important aspect of a film or TV series and without that info, viewers are not going to know what to watch. I did not feel like the age column was necessary for this data because I did not see the importance of figuring out how old the movie was from the year it was released to now. So I think that was another limitation in this dataset.
